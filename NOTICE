   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   
   1. Definitions.

      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
   
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
   
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
   
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
   
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
   
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
   
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
   
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
   
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
   does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
   Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
   other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
   information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
   warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
   terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons

   Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
   
   Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
   conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
   original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
   and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
   following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
   exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
   
        Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
        intended for use by those authorized to give the public
        permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
        copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
        irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
        and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
        Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
        applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
        material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
        material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
        licensed material, or material used under an exception or
        limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
   	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
   
        Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
        licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
        the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
        example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
        copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
        licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
        other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
        the licensed material may still be restricted for other
        reasons, including because others have copyright or other
        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
        such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
        Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
        respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
        for the public:

   =======================================================================
   
   Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
   
   By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
   to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
   Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
   extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
   granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
   these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
   consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
   Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
   
   
   Section 1 -- Definitions.
   
     a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
        Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
        and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
        arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
        permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
        Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
        Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
        Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
        synched in timed relation with a moving image.
   
     b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
        and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
        accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
   
     c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
        closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
        performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
        Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
        categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
        specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
        Rights.
   
     d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
        absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
        fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
        Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
        agreements.
   
     e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
        any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
        that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
   
     f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
        or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
        License.
   
     g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
        terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
        all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
        Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
   
     h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
        under this Public License.
   
     i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
        process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
        as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
        dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
        available to the public including in ways that members of the
        public may access the material from a place and at a time
        individually chosen by them.
   
     j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
        resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
        the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
        as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
        equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
   
     k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
        under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
   
   
   Section 2 -- Scope.
   
     a. License grant.
   
          1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
             the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
             non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
             exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
   
               a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                  in part; and
   
               b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
   
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
             Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
             License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
             its terms and conditions.
   
          3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
             6(a).
   
          4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
             Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
             all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
             and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
             Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
             authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
             necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
             technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
             Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
             simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
             (4) never produces Adapted Material.
   
          5. Downstream recipients.
   
               a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                  recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                  receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                  Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                  Public License.
   
               b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                  any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                  apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                  Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                  Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                  Material.
   
          6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
             may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
             are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
             with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
             the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
             provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
   
     b. Other rights.
   
          1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
             licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
             privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
             the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
             assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
             extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
             Rights, but not otherwise.
   
          2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
             Public License.
   
          3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
             collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
             Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
             under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
             licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
             reserves any right to collect such royalties.
   
   
   Section 3 -- License Conditions.
   
   Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
   following conditions.
   
     a. Attribution.
   
          1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
             form), You must:
   
               a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                  with the Licensed Material:
   
                    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                       Material and any others designated to receive
                       attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                       the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                       designated);
   
                   ii. a copyright notice;
   
                  iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
   
                   iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                       warranties;
   
                    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                       extent reasonably practicable;
   
               b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                  retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
   
               c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                  Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                  hyperlink to, this Public License.
   
          2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
             reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
             which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
             reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
             hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
             information.
   
          3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
             information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
             reasonably practicable.
   
          4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
             License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
             Material from complying with this Public License.
   
   
   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
   
   Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
   apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
   
     a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
        to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
        portion of the contents of the database;
   
     b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
        contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
        Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
        Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
   
     c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
        all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
   
   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
   replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
   Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
   
   
   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
   
     a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
        EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
        AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
        ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
        IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
        WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
        ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
        KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
        ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
   
     b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
        TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
        NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
        COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
        USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
        DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
        IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
   
     c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
        above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
        possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
        waiver of all liability.
   
   
   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
   
     a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
        Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
        this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
        terminate automatically.
   
     b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
        Section 6(a), it reinstates:
   
          1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
             it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
             violation; or
   
          2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
   
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
        right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
        of this Public License.
   
     c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
        will not terminate this Public License.
   
     d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
        License.
   
   
   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
   
     a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
        terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
   
     b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
        Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
        independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
   
   
   Section 8 -- Interpretation.
   
     a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
        shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
        conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
        be made without permission under this Public License.
   
     b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
        deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
        minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
        cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
        without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
        conditions.
   
     c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
        failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
        Licensor.
   
     d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
        as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
        that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
        processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   
      1. Definitions.
   
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
   
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.
   
         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.
   
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.
   
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   
      1. Definitions.
   
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
   
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.
   
         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.
   
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.
   
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
